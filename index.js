/*7
* Accessing Values in Arrays

var partyList = ["carrot cake", "rocky road ice cream", "mochiko chicken", "orange tang", "lemon bars"];

What is the length of this array? Please console.log the length only.
What index position is carrot cake? Please console.log this item.
What index position is lemon bars? Please console.log this item.

/*
* #8 
* Concatenation 
* Concatenate the variables `firstName` and `lastName` and store this to a new variable called `fullName`.

* Concatenate the variables `fullName` and `birthPlace` to create the following sentence:
 xx xx is from xx.

/**
* #9 Arithmetic
* Variables with the outcome of an arithmetic operation.
* Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2` and assign each of these variables a number of your choosing.
* Next perform the following arithmetic operations:

* Add the two variables and store it to new variable named sum.
* Subtract the two variables and store it to a new variable named difference.
* Mulitply the two variables and store it to a new variable named product.
* Divide the two variables and store it to a new variable named quotent.
* What is the remainder when you divide num1 by num2?


/**
* #10
* Comparisons & Logic
* Variables with the outcome of a comparison operation:
*
* Declare a variable named isEqual and compare two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" using the strict equality.
* Declare another variable named isEqualed and compare the two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" using equality.
* Console.log both variables. What are the differences between the two and why?

* Declare a variable named sameNum and compare a string "5" and a number 5 using strict equality.
* Declare another variable named sameNumba and compare a string "5" and a number 5 using equality.
* Console.log both variables. What are the differences between the two and why?

* Use the logical and && and or || and compare the following:
* 3>2 3<1 (use or)
* 3>2 6>3 (use and)
* 7>2 8<5 (use and)
* Declare variables and console.log the results. What are the differences between the three and why?


/**
* #11
* Assignments
* Variables with the outcome of an assignment operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `myBox` and assign it with a number of your choosing.
* This variable will be used to store multiple types of values as we assign them to show how variables in JavaScript are not bound to a single data type
* and can change values.

* Write 5 different assignment statements and `console.log()` the value of the variable after each
* assignment statement to show the current value.
*



/**
* Final Boss 
* Additional exercises designed to challenge you and give you a jump start on the next topic that'll be covered.
* Declare Functions
*
* Declare a Function named `jump` which takes a single argument, `height`
*
* This function should return a String, "You jumped 9 feet high!"
* if invoked in this way -> jump(9);
*
* Store the return value to a variable named `jumpResult` and use console.log to inspect the value which was returned by your function
**/



/**


*
* Declare a Function named `cook` which a takes three arguments/parameters, `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `recipeName`
*
* This function should return a String along the lines of, "Tomatoes and Cheese make a Pizza!"
* if invoked in this way -> cook("Tomatoes", "Cheese", "Pizza");
