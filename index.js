/**
* #1
* Variables with a String value
*
* Declare variables named `firstName`, `lastName`, `birthPlace`, `favoriteFood`, `bestMovie`, `favLoveSong`, `cuteAnimal`, `favColor`, `favSneaker`, `coffeeShop`.
* Fill out the values for these with your own data or make it up.
*
* It should be a String.

*
* Declare variables named `favoriteNumber`, `currentYear`, `thatOnePrinceSong`, 'tokyoOlympics`, `mariahCareyAge`, `currentTemp`, `studentsInClass`, `numOfJapanPrefectures`, `currentIphoneModel` and `shoeSize`.     
*
* Their values should be a Number

*
* Declare variables named `likesMcDonalds`, `watchedMrRobot`, `ranMarathon`, `wrestledABear`, `lovesDonuts`, `readHarryPotter`, `sleptInClass`, `drinksCoffee`, `shopsAtWholeFoods` and `ownsRedShoes`.

* Their values should be a Boolean
**/



/**
* #4
* Variables with a Null value
*
* Declare variables named `completedPrepClass`, `traveledToMars` and `scoredTDinNFL`.
*
* Their values should be a Null value

/**
* #6
* Variables with an Array value
* 
* Declare a variable named 'plateLunch` and assign it with 5 of your favorite lunch items.
* Declare a variavle named `fruitBasket` and assign it with 5 fruits of your choosing.
* Declare a variable named `westCoast` and assign it with states found on the west coast of the US.
* Declare a variable named `lotteryResult and assign it with 5 random numbers.
* Declare a variable named `duets` and assign it with 3 arrays, each containing names of 2 singers or bands.

/**
* #6a Arithmetic
* Variables with the outcome of an arithmetic operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `sumOfNumbers` which is a Number. This Number
* contains the result of performing an arithmetic operation on two numbers.
* Have this variable store the result of adding 3 numbers of your choosing.
*
* Extend this behavior to include subtraction, multiplication and division.
*/




/**
* #6b Comparisons & Logic
* Variables with the outcome of a comparison operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `isEqual` which is a Boolean. This Boolean
* contains the result of performing a comparison to test if two strings
* are equal. We want to compare the two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" and
* `console.log()` the result.
*
* NOTE:
*   There is no test which tests your console.log()'s output'.
*   Also, there are zero tests for the BONUS below.
*
* BONUS:
*   See if you can come up with a few examples of double comparison
*   operator(==) vs triple comparison operator(===).

/**
* #6c Assignments
* Variables with the outcome of an assignment operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `generalContainer`. This variable will be used to store multiple types of
* values as we assign them to show how variables in JavaScript are not bound to a single data type
* and can change values.
*
* Write 5 different assignment statements and `console.log()` the value of the variable after each
* assignment statement to show the current value.
*
* NOTE:
*   The tests for this section cannot test your variable as it changes,
*   it can only test that you declared the variable by giving it the right name.

/**
* #7a
* Declare Functions
*
* Declare a Function named `jump` which takes a single argument, `height`

* This function should return a String, "You jumped 9 feet high!"
* if invoked in this way -> jump(9);
*
* Store the return value to a variable named `jumpResult` and use console.log to inspect the value which was returned by your function

/**
* #7b
* Declare Functions
*
* Declare a Function named `cook` which a takes three arguments/parameters, `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `recipeName`
*
* This function should return a String along the lines of, "Tomatoes and Cheese make a Pizza!"
* if invoked in this way -> cook("Tomatoes", "Cheese", "Pizza");
