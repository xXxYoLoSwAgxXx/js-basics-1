* #1
* Variables with a "String" value

* Declare variables named firstName, lastName, birthPlace, favFood, favDrink, favSong, favAnimal, favColor, favSport, favDoughnut.

* Assign your own string values to each variable and console.log each variable.
*/



/*
* #2
* Variables with a Number value
*
* Declare variables named favNumber, yourShoeSize, thatOnePrinceSong, floorsAlaMoanaHotel, numOfJapanPrefectures, numOfABCstoresinHi, and cheesecakesFlavAtCheeseCakeFac
*
* Assign your own number values to each variable and console.log each variable.

/*
* #3
* Variables with a Boolean value
*
* Declare variables named likesMcDonalds, eatsDoughnuts and ownsRedShoes.
*
* Assign your own boolean values to each variable and console.log each variable.
*
* 
* Now, use comparison and logic operators (>, <, >=, <=, ===, !==) to make the following variables True of False
*
* Console.log each variable.
*

//For example:
//Make me True:
var booya1 = 3 > 2;

var booya2;

//Make me True:
var booya3;

//Make me False:
var booya4;

//Make me True:
var booya5; 

//Make me False:
var booya6;



/*
* #4
* Variables with a Null value
*
* Declare variables named completedPrepClass, traveledToMars and buyVicADrink.
*
* Assign a null value to each variable and console.log each variable. 
*/



/*
* #5
* Variables with a undefined value.
*
* Declare a variable named superBowlChamps, nextPres and hawaiiRail.
*
* Do not assign a value to the variable and console.log each variable.

/*
* #6
* Variables with an Array value
* 
* Declare a variable named plateLunch and assign it an array containing 5 of your favorite lunch items.
* Declare a variable named `donutBox` and assign it an array containing 5 donuts of your choosing.
* Declare a variable named `westCoast` and assign it an array containing states found on the west coast of the US.
* Declare a variable named `lotteryResult and assign it an array containing 5 random numbers.
* Declare a variable named `hamajang` and assign it an array containing 6 different data types.
* Declare a variable named `dynamicDuos` and assign it an array containing 3 arrays, with each array containing items that match with one another.
*
* Console.log each variable.

* Accessing values in Arrays

var partyList = ["carrot cake", "gin & tonic", "kalua pork nachos", "double stuff oreos", "cool ranch doritos", "orange chicken"];

Console.log the length of this array.
Console.log only "carrot cake" from this array.
Console.log only "cool ranch doritos" from this array

/*
* #8 
* Concatenation 
* Concatenate the variables `firstName` and `lastName` from exercise 1 and store them into a new variable called `fullName` (don't forget to include a space between the firstName and lastName).
*
* Using the fullName and birthPlace variables, console.log the following:
*
* "Hi my name is fullName and I was born in birthPlace." 
*
* i.e "Hi my name is Bruce Wayne and I was born in Gotham."
*/



/*
* #9 Arithmetic
* Variables with the outcome of an arithmetic operation.
* Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2` and assign each of these variables a number of your choosing.
* Next perform the following arithmetic operations:

* Add the two variables and store it to new variable named sum.
* Subtract the two variables and store it to a new variable named difference.
* Mulitply the two variables and store it to a new variable named product.
* Divide the two variables and store it to a new variable named quotient.
* Find the remainder (modulus) of the two variables and store in to a new variable names leftOver.
*
* Console.log each new variable.

/*
* #10
* Comparisons & Logic
* Variables with the outcome of a comparison operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `isStrictlyEqual` and compare two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" using the strict equality.
* Declare another variable named `isLooselyEqual` and compare the two strings "Tacocat" and "tacocat" using equality.
* Print both variables to the console. If the answers are different, why? If not, why not? Write you answer two or three commented-out sentences.

* Declare a variable named `sameNum` and compare a string "5" and a number 5 using strict equality.
* Declare another variable named `sameNumba` and compare a string "5" and a number 5 using equality.
* Print both variables to the console. If the answers are different, why? If not, why not? Write you answer two or three commented-out sentences.
*/

/*
* Use the logical && or || and compare the following:
* 3>2 3<1 (use or)
* 3>2 6>3 (use and)
* 7>2 8<5 (use and)
* Declare variables and print the results to the console. What are the differences between the three and why?*/



/*
* #11
* Assignments
* Variables with the outcome of an assignment operation:
*
* Declare a variable named `myBox` and assign it with a number of your choosing.
* This variable will be used to store multiple types of values as we assign them to show how variables in JavaScript are not bound to a single data type
* and can change values.

* Write 5 different assignment statements and `console.log()` the value of the variable after each
* assignment statement to show the current value. REMEMBER: an assignment is DIFFERENT from a declaration.

/*
* Final Boss 
* Additional exercises designed to further challenge you and give you a jump start on the next topic that'll be covered.
* Function - A block of code designed to perform a particular task. It allows you to reuse code.
*
* Declare a function named `bakePie` which has a single parameter 'ingredient'.
* When the function is invoked, it should return a string, "Today's special ingredient pie." Where ingredient will be the value that you pass into the function.
* For example, if the value is `blueberry`, it should return "Today's special blueberry pie."
* Declare a variable 'pieResult' and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.*/


/*
* Declare a Function named `jump` which has a single parameter, `height`.
* This function should return a string, "You jumped height feet high!" Where height will be the value that you pass into the function.
* For example, if the value is 9, it should return "You jumped 9 feet high!"



* Declare a variable 'jumpResult' and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.*/


/*
* Declare a Function named `cook` which a takes three parameters, `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `recipeName`.
* This function should return a String along the lines of, "Tomatoes and Cheese make a Pizza!"
* if invoked in this way -> cook("Tomatoes", "Cheese", "Pizza");
