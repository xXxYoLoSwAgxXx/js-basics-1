* Final Boss 

* The following exercises are designed to further challenge you and give you a jump start on the next topic that'll be covered. Let the boss battle begin!
*
* Function - A block of code designed to perform a particular task. It allows you to reuse code.
*
* Declare a function named bakePie which has a single parameter ingredient.
* 
* When the function is invoked, it should return a string, "Today's special is ingredient pie." Where ingredient will be the value that you pass into the function.
* 
* For example, if the value is `blueberry`, it should return "Today's special is blueberry pie."
* 
* Declare a variable pieResult and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.*/


/*
* Declare a Function named jump which has a single parameter, height.
* 
* This function should return a string, "You jumped height feet high!" Where height will be the value that you pass into the function.
* 
* For example, if the value is 9, it should return "You jumped 9 feet high!"

* Declare a variable jumpResult and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.
*/


/*
* Declare a Function named makeFood which takes three parameters, ingredient1, ingredient2, recipeName.
* 
* This function should return a string ingredient1 and ingredient2 make a recipeName. Where ingredient1, ingredient2 and recipeName will be the values that you pass into the function.
* 
* For example, if the values are "Cheese", "Bacon", "pancake" it should return "Cheese and bacon make a pancake."
*
* Declare a variable foodResult and assign it to the function call. Console.log the variable to see the result.
